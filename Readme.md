# manage-this-node

NodeJS version of [Muximux](https://github.com/mescon/Muximux/) and [Managethis](https://github.com/Tenzinn3/Managethis)

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) v4.2.x
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository or download the ZIP and extract it
git clone https://github.com/onedr0p/manage-this-node
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd manage-this-node
npm install
```

### Upgrading
It's a good idea to run `npm install` to avoid any problems.

### Configuration

```bash
# Copy config.json.template to config.json
cp config.json.template config.json
```

In `config.json` fill in the `port` you want to use if you don't want to use port `3000`.

Everything else can be handled when the app is running via the settings menu.

**Important note**: If you must change the `config.json` file by hand, restart the app to see the changes.

Basic auth is available by passing `BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` through environment variables.

```bash
BASIC_AUTH_USER=user BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=password npm start
```

### Start the app

```bash
# Start the app
npm start
```

Open `localhost:3000` in your browser to see the app.

### Running forever
To have the app run forever in the background

```bash
# Install forever
npm install forever -g

# Run
forever start ./bin/www

# Stop
forever stop ./bin/www
```

Goto `localhost:3000` to see the app.

### Docker
A dockerfile for this has been provided by [chimpchimp](https://github.com/chimpchimp) [here](https://github.com/chimpchimp/docker-manage-this-node)

App Specific Workarounds
---------------
**Emby**  
By Default Emby sends a header that prevents loading in an iframe.   

Windows:
* Edit `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\MediaBrowser-Server\config\system.xml`  
* Look for `<DenyIFrameEmbedding>true</DenyIFrameEmbedding>` replace `true` with `false`  
* Should look like `<DenyIFrameEmbedding>false</DenyIFrameEmbedding>`  
* Save the file and restart Emby  

Additional Information
